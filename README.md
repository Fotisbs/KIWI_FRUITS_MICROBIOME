## The provided material includes the code used in the statistical analysis of the study.

For obtaining the code the users need to open a terminal and having the [GitHub tools](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), git-clone or download the repository, and enter the base folder. E.g:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Fotisbs/Grapevine_Vinifications_Vidiano_2019-.git
```

In the case of the computational methods, with the "Grapevine_Vinifications_Vidiano_2019-" folder as working directory, and assuming that the necessary software and R packages are installed, the used code can be executed as described in this Readme.md file. The necessary datasets for performing all sequencing based analysis can be downloaded implementing the code provided in the corresponding repository folders as explained below.

## Description of the order of executed scripts.

For Fungi and Bacteria files, steps 0-2 concern the data retrieval from NCBI and preprocessing (demultiplex), while step 3 and the subfolders concern the actual data analysis.

0) First, it is necessary to download the sequencing data.
To do so, you need to enter the "0.DownloadData" subfolder of "Fungi" and "Bacteria" folders accordingly and execute the "fetch_data.sh" bash script for batch (01), this assumes that you are located at the working directory "Grapevine_Vinifications_Vidiano_2019-"). The NCBI submitted amplicons are includes at those batch/files.The script is based on the SRR accession numbers for each batch file and can be found in the 0.DownloadData folder as a.txt file.
Once the download is done, you need to combine all forward reads to a single file and all reverse reads to another file as well.
```
for i in {01}
do
	cd Fungi/0.DownloadData/batch${i}
	sh -x fetch_data.sh
	cat *_1.fastq | gzip > forward.fastq.gz
	cat *_2.fastq | gzip > reverse.fastq.gz
	cd ../../../
	cd Bacteria/0.DownloadData/batch${i}
	sh -x fetch_data.sh
	cat *_1.fastq | gzip > forward.fastq.gz
	cat *_2.fastq | gzip > reverse.fastq.gz
	cd ../../../
done
```

1) Then you need to demultiplex the data according to our own demultiplexing method using our in-house script.
This requires Flexbar v3.0.3 to be installed, and the mapping file (map_file) accordingly for Fungi and Bacteria that is also provided in each file.
A detailed description of our in-house multiplexing approach is provided in our [previous work] (https://github.com/SotiriosVasileiadis/mconsort_tbz_degr#16s).
You need to enter the folder Fungi/1.Demultiplex and run the following commands (change the MY_PROCS variable to whatever number of logical processors you have available and want to devote).
the following commands are going to save the demultiplexed files in the Fungi(or Bacteria)/1.Demultiplex/demux_out folder.
```
MY_WORKING_DIR_BASE=`pwd`
for i in {01}
do
  cd Fungi/1.Demultiplex
  MY_PROCS=56
  bash DemuxOwnBCsys_absPATH.sh demux_out${i} ${MY_WORKING_DIR_BASE}/Fungi/0.DownloadData/batch${i}/forward.fastq.gz ${MY_WORKING_DIR_BASE}/Fungi/0.DownloadData/batch${i}/reverse.fastq.gz fun${i}Fungi_map_file.txt ${MY_PROCS}
  cd demux_out${i}/analysis_ready
  gunzip *.gz # unzips files skipped by the Demux script
  cd ../../../../
  cd Bacteria/1.Demultiplex
  MY_PROCS=56
  bash DemuxOwnBCsys_absPATH.sh demux_ou${i} ${MY_WORKING_DIR_BASE}/Fungi/0.DownloadData/batch${i}/forward.fastq.gz ${MY_WORKING_DIR_BASE}/Fungi/0.DownloadData/batch${i}/reverse.fastq.gz bac${i}Bacteria_map_file.txt ${MY_PROCS}
  cd demux_out${i}/analysis_ready
  gunzip *.gz # unzips files skipped by the Demux script
  cd ../../../../
done

cd Fungi/1.Demultiplex
mkdir -p demux_out/analysis_ready
cp demux_out[0-9]/analysis_ready/*.fastq demux_out/analysis_ready/
cd ../../

cd Bacteria/1.Demultiplex
mkdir -p demux_out/analysis_ready
cp demux_out[0-9]/analysis_ready/*.fastq demux_out/analysis_ready/
cd ../../
```
2) Following, the "Vinification Vidiano 2019 Quality-Classification-Phyloseq Object.R" script of the Fungi(or Bacteria)/2.PhyloseqObjectPreparation folder is run in order to prepare the final phyloseq object to be used in the data analysis described below. Before running the script make sure that the necessary reference databases are found in the same folder. The taxonomic annotations of the resulting fungal and bacterial ASVs were performed using the UNITE ITS v.8.2 (04.02.2020) (Morrison-Whittle et al., 2017) and the Silva v.138 (Yilmaz et al., 2014) databases as references respectively. The sample data informations is also needed for the final construction of phyloseq objects which is also included in the files accordingly as samdf.txt. 
```
cd Fungi/2.PhyloseqObjectPreparation
# fetch the databases
wget https://files.plutof.ut.ee/public/orig/1D/B9/1DB95C8AC0A80108BECAF1162D761A8D379AF43E2A4295A3EF353DD1632B645B.gz
# run the R script
Fungi Vinification Vidiano 2019 Quality-Classification-Phyloseq Object.r
cd ../../
cd Bacteria/2.PhyloseqObjectPreparation
# fetch the databases
wget https://zenodo.org/record/4587955/files/silva_nr99_v138.1_train_set.fa.gz
wget https://zenodo.org/record/4587955/files/silva_nr99_v138.1_wSpecies_train_set.fa.gz
tar vxf *.gz
# run the R script
Bacteria Vinification Vidiano 2019 Quality-Classification-Phyloseq Object.r
cd ../../
```
3) Data analysis folder include subfolders for each analysis graphs supplied at the researched article "Metataxonomic and metatranscriptomic analysis reveal microbial succession and metabolic pathways activated during spontaneous and inoculated vinification". Subfolders contain the R script to be executed for "Fungi" and "Bacteria" for both main and supplementary figures. 
```

3a. Run Bar Plots Analysis

3b. Run NMDS Analysis

3c. Run PERMANOVA Analysis

Further on continue for the supplementary graphs

3d. Run Rarefaction curves

3e. Run The α-diversity Shannon index

3f. Run the Differential abundance (DA) heatmaps for microbiome dataset
```

For Metatranscriptomic file step 0 concern the data retrieval from NCBI and preprocessing, while step 1-2 and the subfolders concern the actual data analysis.

0) First, it is necessary to download the RNA sequencing data.
To do so, you need to enter the "0.DownloadData" subfolder of "Metatranscriptomic" and execute the "fetch_data.sh" bash script for batch (01), this assumes that you are located at the working directory "Grapevine_Vinifications_Vidiano_2019-"). The NCBI submitted RNA sequences are includes at those batch/files.The script is based on the SRR accession numbers for each batch file and can be found in the 0.DownloadData folder as a.txt file.
Once the download is done, you need to combine all forward reads to a single file and all reverse reads to another file as well.
```
for i in {01}
do
	cd Metatranscriptomic/0.DownloadData/batch${i}
	sh -x fetch_data.sh
	cat *_1.fastq | gzip > forward.fastq.gz
	cat *_2.fastq | gzip > reverse.fastq.gz
	cd ../../../
done
```

1) The retrieved sequence reads were processed with the SAMSA2 v2.2.0 pipeline (Westreich et al., 2018) for functional annotation. The functional annotation output is provided in the current folder as a txt file, also the experimental design file is needed with the info for the RNA samples in order to procced, the file is also provided with the name ExperimentalDesigh.txt. This is the starting point for the next step of the analysis for the metatranscriptomic data.

2) Data analysis folder include subfolders for each analysis graphs supplied at the researched article "Metataxonomic and metatranscriptomic analysis reveal microbial succession and metabolic pathways activated during spontaneous and inoculated vinification". Subfolders contain the R script to be executed for "Metatranscriptomic" for both main and supplementary figures. 
```
2a. Run NMDS Analysis

2b. Run PERMANOVA Analysis

2c. Run Volcano plot for the differentially expressed genes

2d. Run Differential abundance (DA) heatmaps for metatranscriptomic dataset
